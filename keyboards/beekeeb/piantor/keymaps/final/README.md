This keymap combines all the lessons I've learnt from the previous ones (uses the QMK-prepared file to translate from qwerty to azerty). It makes a split keyboard with as layout 3x6_3 (3 rows of 6 keys; 3 thumb keys -> on each side) type with the colemak-DH layout on the default layer (and custom placements, combo's etc. on the other layers). It assumes the Belgian (punt) azerty is active.
